INTRODUCTION TO STRINGS

POINTS:
1)In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.

2)The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).

3)A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. 

4)String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.

5)Depending on the programming language and precise data type used, a variable declared to be a string may either cause storage in memory to be statically allocated for a predetermined maximum length or employ dynamic allocation to allow it to hold a variable number of elements.
When a string appears literally in source code, it is known as a string literal or an anonymous string.

String is a sequence of characters. In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.


CREATING A STRING IN JAVA

There are two ways to create string in Java:

String literal
String s = “GeeksforGeeks”;
Using new keyword
String s = new String (“GeeksforGeeks”);


REST OF THE POINTS ARE COVERED IN NOTES.
